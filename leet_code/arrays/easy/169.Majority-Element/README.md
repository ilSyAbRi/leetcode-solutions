# Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.<br>

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.<br>

### Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [3,2,3]<br>
Output: 3<br>
### Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]<br>
Output: 2<br>
 
---

### Constraints:<br>

n == nums.length<br>
1 <= n <= 5 * 104<br>
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109<br>
