Just me, and C of course — sitting together, trying to understand each other through some exercises.  
I am the only one who tries to understand her; this relationship exists only on my side.  
Someday, C looks at me. 🚀💡

Don't think of it as a toxic relationship — it just takes time.  
Both of us should try to see the other, or I try to be in the right place to get the things that appear in the right place: I focus on my way to understand her, and C focuses on her way to show herself, to have a healthy relationship 🌱✨.

Really, if you do your best, you don’t have the right to stress about the future, so try to do what you can even if it’s not your best but it’s your best at that moment, and don’t worry about your position — just do, and let things happen to have a healthy relationship with the world 🌍💫.
